Hello,

Please forgive me the CPP large files :(
I don't like create big source code files, but i rly don't know how handle the QT library correctly from SWAD side so please forgive me.

Handling with large one source file in QT creator isn't a big disadvatage just please check option "UnFoldAll" under: Preferences:Environment:Keyboard

However, if you use a outline or as I say the assign shortcut to UnFoldall - for me it hasn't been for me too unconvience to handling with large QT source code files. 

I tried name the code function names as readily as possible. I belive that if you would manage to understand the code - you should be able to! Good luck!
