Handling with large one source file in QT creator is very simpe just please check option "UnFoldAll" under: Preferences:Environment:Keyboard

However, if you use a outline or as I say if you assign shortcut to UnFoldall - for me it hasn't been unconvience to handling with large QT source code files. 

I tried name the code function names as readily as possible. I belive that if you would be able to manage understand the code, you should be able to! Good luck!
