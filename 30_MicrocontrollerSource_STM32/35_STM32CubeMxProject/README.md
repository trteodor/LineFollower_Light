# FAST_Line_Follower_STM32H7
* All MCU Source files was compiled using STM32CubeIDE 1.6.1, stm32cube_fw_h7_v170 package (it's important info, please use this version of STM32CubeIDE) 

* Second suggested option and recommended by me is to use "makefile" for compilation. If you are familiar with compilation process with makefiles the I suppose that you are with me with this though :) 

* The Debug folder contain compiled files for MCU

Used MCU: STM32H743VITx
