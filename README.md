* If i will have time i will continue the project!  :) 

  * The estimated cost of all components needed to recreate this design (in full) is around 150 $ (PCB order included) ( Just for information )

# Here is my previous working and tested Line Follower project:
* https://github.com/trteodor/Line_Follower_STM32H7



# In this project:

PCB and 3D Assemblyis prepared, real world prototype prepared

TODO:

* Save map in Sd Card
* Add support for MPU-6050
* Add support for VL53l0
* Generally much things..

The repository contains all the files used to create this project (PCB, Assemblies, Microcontroller Source Code)

# Few Photos

Assembly without VL53
