# Light Follower Light

Demonstration video:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPPqBeZhOw

  * You will need to spend around 200$ if you want recreate this design (PCB order included)

In Embedded source code is implemented many algorithms, PID Controller is used to follow for the black line on white theme. 

Nevertheless many things still can be done much better - Let's be honest - the prepared Control Code in my opinion is somewhere between a draft and a prototype

# You can also check my previous Line Follower Project:
* https://github.com/trteodor/Line_Follower_STM32H7

# In this project:

PCB and 3D Assemblyis prepared, real world prototype prepared

TODO:
* Add support for MPU-6050
* Add support for VL53l0
* Generally much things..
* Development of QT service application..

The repository contains all the files used to create this project (PCB, Assemblies, Microcontroller Source Code)
