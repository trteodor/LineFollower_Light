# Light Follower Light

Demonstration video:

* If i will have time i will continue the project!  :) 

  * The estimated cost of all components needed to recreate this design (in full) 150 $ (around) (PCB order included) ( Just for information )

In Embedded source code is implemented many algorithms but generally - PID Controller is used to follow for the black line on white theme. But rly many things still can be done much better :) ( Let's say the truth - prepared Control Code in my opinion it's only draft )

# You can also check my previous Line Follower Project:
* https://github.com/trteodor/Line_Follower_STM32H7

# In this project:

PCB and 3D Assemblyis prepared, real world prototype prepared

TODO:

* Save map in Sd Card
* Add support for MPU-6050
* Add support for VL53l0
* Generally much things..

The repository contains all the files used to create this project (PCB, Assemblies, Microcontroller Source Code)

# Few Photos

Assembly without VL53
